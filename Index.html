      <p>The Lore Server is under siege.</p>
      <p>As tensions between The Obsidian Order and The Crimson Vanguard exploded into full-blown war, the skies turned dark with bombs dropping across the land. Explosions shook the ground as bases were flattened and forests turned to fire.</p>
      <p>Villagers fled in terror, their cries echoing through shattered towns. Roads are broken, crops destroyed, and once-safe zones reduced to rubble.</p>
      <p>"We never saw it coming," one survivor whispered. "They came from above. Everything burned."</p>
      <p>The Order fights to hold their final fortress as Vanguard forces close in. With every minute, the server inches closer to collapse.</p>

        <p>“Why the Realms Burn”</p>
        <p>Long ago, the world of Lore Server was whole — united under the Council of Builders, a peaceful alliance of factions who shared resources, balanced redstone and magic, and protected the land from griefers and chaos.</p>
        <p>At the heart of this alliance was a sacred relic: The Core Block — a mysterious, indestructible artifact said to control the balance of time, power, and terrain generation. Only the Council had access to it… until one fateful day.</p>
        <p>One faction, known as The Crimson Vanguard, broke away.</p>
	<p>They believed the Core Block was being hoarded by the old powers, limiting progress and suppressing innovation. Their leader, General Flint, called for “a new world shaped by fire and strength,” and declared war on the Council — now defended only by its strongest remaining force, The Obsidian Order.</p>
	<p>Tensions simmered for weeks.</p>
	<p>Trade routes were cut. Ambassadors vanished. Border towns were raided. Then, one day… the skies opened. Bombs rained down.</p>
	<p>The First Strike leveled Quartz Harbor, and with it, the last hope for peace.</p>
	<p>Now, both sides battle for control — one to liberate the Core, the other to protect it at all costs.</p>
	<p>The land is divided. The skies are falling. And the Core Block waits…</p>
	<p>Will power destroy the realm — or decide who rules it?</p>

	<p>Yes, you read that right — nearly 9 out of 10 players stand with Bedrock, marching under the banner of mobile and console dominance. Meanwhile, the Java loyalists, known for their mods, speedruns, and PvP tactics, hold a small but fierce 10%. And in the shadows, a mysterious 1% claim loyalty to both versions, often acting as spies or peacemakers in this digital war.</p>
	<p>As the Battle for the Core Block continues, these numbers shape the fate of the realm. With Bedrock forces growing stronger every day, the question must be asked:</p>

      <h3>THE CURSE OF THE SEA</h3>
      <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/RV6W7dxT/Screenshot-2025-07-04-191505.png" alt="Port Town Mystery">
      <p>The Treasure That No Pirate Could Claim</p>
      <p>Some say it's a myth. Others swear it’s real.
But all agree on one thing: every pirate who searched for it is now dead.</p>
      <p>Deep beneath the crashing waves of the Darkwater Sea, beyond the coral graves and shipwrecked ruins, lies a treasure said to be so powerful, it could rewrite the fate of the entire realm.</p>
      <p>Once owned by the infamous pirate lord Captain Dreadhook, the treasure was buried centuries ago on an island that doesn’t appear on any map. Legend says Dreadhook made a deal with the sea itself — hiding the treasure in exchange for immortality. But when he betrayed the ocean and tried to escape with it... the sea cursed him.</p>
      <p>His ship was never seen again</p>
      <p>Since then, many have tried to find it. All have failed.</p>
      <p>Sailors whisper of siren songs, ghost ships, and waters that boil without warning.</p>
      <p>"The sea protects what belongs to it," says Old Jeb, a weathered fisherman who claims to have seen the Heart once — glowing red under the tide. "And if you try to steal from her, she’ll take more than your soul."</p>
      <p>Will you be the next fool to chase it?</p>
